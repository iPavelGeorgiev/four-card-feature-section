# Four card feature section

![Responsive mockup](design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is my solution to the [four card feature section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK). Frontend Mentor is a platform where developers can learn and improve their frontend development skills alongside other developers by implementing solutions to challenges. Each challenge includes designs (both mobile and desktop), assets, and a style guide to get you started. The rest is up to you!

## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this four card feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.

I don't have access to the premium Figma/Sketch files, so the design is not pixel perfect.
